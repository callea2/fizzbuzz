# Fizz buzz

### The objective
To write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

### Why?
The Fizz buzz test is commonly used as an interview screening device for programmers. This was one of the first thing I approached when learning Ruby and it provided a very good learning experience.
